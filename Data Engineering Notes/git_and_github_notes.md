# Git and GitHub

## Version Control
- A version control system is a tool that allows you to track the history and attribution of project files over time. This allows for collaboration among developers within the same team and among different teams.
- Version control systems allow for easy collaboration by allowing individuals to work on different features of the same project in parallel without having their work interfere with one another.
  - The main aspect of version control is a repository, which acts as a sandbox for each worker. Workers can work on individual features and "push" those features to a remote version of the repository individually.

## What is Git
- Git is a distributed version control system, meaning there is no singular main server and full history of a project can be made available through a cloned copy of a remote repository.
- A repository is a collection of commits and branches saved in a .git directory.
- A commit is a snapshot of a project and the changes made to it at a certain point in time. HEAD is the name of the most recent commit in a particular branch of the repository. It can also refer to the commit you currently have checked out.
- A branch is a collection of commits within a repository. The primary branch of a repository is the 'main' branch.
